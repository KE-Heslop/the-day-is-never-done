# the-day-is-never-done

## Description
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save notes for each hour of the day by enetering text into a hour block on a time grid. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The Moment.js library is used to handle date and time.

## Use
The app will:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
* Allow a user to enter an event or notes when they click a timeblock
* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
* Persist events between refreshes of a page
